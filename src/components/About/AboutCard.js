            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Abinash Sinha</span> from{" "}
            <span className="purple">Lucknow, India.</span>
            <br />
            I am currently working as a <strong>Full-Stack Engineer</strong> at{" "}
            <span className="purple">Aayan Infotech Pvt. Ltd.</span>, where I build and maintain scalable web applications using the MERN stack with AWS cloud deployment.
            <br />
            I hold an <strong>Integrated MCA</strong> degree in Computer Application from{" "}
            <span className="purple">Chandigarh University</span>.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have approximately 3 years of professional experience, having previously worked on projects involving React, Vue.js, Node.js, Stripe integrations, and AWS cloud infrastructure.
            <br />
            <br />
            My technical skills include React.js, React Native, Next.js, Vue.js, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase, SQL, <strong>AWS (EC2, S3, Route 53, CI/CD with Jenkins)</strong>, and payment integrations like Stripe.
            <br />
            <br />
            I enjoy building feature-rich, scalable products from the ground up and deploying them on AWS cloud infrastructure with clean, efficient code.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, here are a few things I love doing:
